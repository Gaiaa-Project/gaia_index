## Repository Directory

> Status badges are used for visibility. Descriptions are intentionally short: each repo README defines the full scope.

| Repository | Purpose | Status |
|---|---|---|
| [**Gaia Core Survival**](https://github.com/Gaiaa-Project/Gaia%20Core%20Survival) | Survival/RPG foundation (progression, systems, rules) | ![Status: Coming soon](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-coming%20soon-lightgrey) |
| [**Gaia HUD Survival**](https://github.com/Gaiaa-Project/Gaia%20HUD%20Survival) | Survival UI / HUD layer | ![Status: Coming soon](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-coming%20soon-lightgrey) |

## Notes

- Repositories may start as **Coming soon** while the structure is being prepared.
- Once published, status should move to **Alpha**, then **Beta**, then **Stable** as the repo matures.
- If a repository spans multiple game modes, it can still appear here — the repo README should clarify boundaries.
