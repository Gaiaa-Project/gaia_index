## Scope

This page lists repositories related to the **Minigames** game mode.

Minigames typically focus on:
- match flow (lobby → game → results)
- scoring, rulesets, round management
- modes (FFA, TDM, etc.)
- minigames-oriented UI/HUD

## Repository Directory

> Status badges are used for visibility. Descriptions are intentionally short: each repo README defines the full scope.

## Notes

- Repositories may start as **Coming soon** while the structure is being prepared.
- Once published, status should move to **Alpha**, then **Beta**, then **Stable** as the repo matures.
- If a repository spans multiple game modes, it can still appear here — the repo README should clarify boundaries.
