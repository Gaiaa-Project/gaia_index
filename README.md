## What is this repository?

**Gaia-Index** is the entry point for the Gaia Project organization.  
It provides a curated map of the ecosystem: repositories, scope, maturity, and navigation links.

If you’re new to Gaia Project, start here.

---

## Browse by Game Mode

Gaia is a **multi–game mode ecosystem**. Each game mode is developed as a coherent stack (core + modules + UI/HUD), because gameplay goals and UX requirements differ.

Start here:

- **Roleplay (Heavy RP)** → [`gamemode/roleplay.md`](./gamemode/roleplay.md)
- **Survival / RPG** → [`gamemode/survival.md`](./gamemode/survival.md)
- **Minigames** → [`gamemode/minigames.md`](./gamemode/minigames.md)

> Future game modes (Zombie, Racing, …) will be added as dedicated pages once they are introduced.

## Meta / Organization

| Repository | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `.github` | Organization profile & shared templates (README, PR/Issue templates, etc.) |
| `gaia-index` | This index (directory, navigation, maturity references) |

---

## Maturity levels

Use these labels consistently across all index pages:

- **Coming soon** — planned / not published yet  
- **Alpha** — early stage, breaking changes expected  
- **Beta** — usable, still evolving  
- **Stable** — production-ready with controlled releases  

> Each game mode page uses badges to make status instantly readable.

---

## Roadmap

Public roadmap: **Coming soon**.

This repository will host (or link to) the roadmap once the ecosystem reaches a stable baseline.

---

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome across Gaia repositories:
- **Issues** — bug reports, feature requests, proposals
- **Pull Requests** — fixes, improvements, well-scoped features, refactors

Each repository is expected to provide:
- `README.md` (scope, setup, usage)
- `LICENSE` (LGPLv3+ unless specified otherwise)
- optionally `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- optionally PR/Issue templates

If you’re unsure where to start, open an issue in the most relevant repo (or in `gaia-index` for ecosystem-level topics).

## License

Unless stated otherwise in a specific repository, Gaia Project repositories are released under:  
**LGPL-3.0-or-later** (see each repository’s `LICENSE` file).
